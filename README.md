# How to see the files

All project-related documents are available in the [Docs](https://github.com/nellitarkka/SmallBusinessDirectory/tree/Docs) branch of the repository.
Each file provides detailed information about specific aspects of the system analysis and design.
If a document does not render directly in GitHub’s preview, it can be downloaded and opened locally using any standard PDF reader.

All files related to the MVP can be found in the [deliverable-II](https://github.com/nellitarkka/SmallBusinessDirectory/tree/deliverable-II) branch
, as well as README files in the respective folders that describe how to set up the database and how to run the frontend and backend.
